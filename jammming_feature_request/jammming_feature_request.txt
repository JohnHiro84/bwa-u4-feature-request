Feature Request

Objective

	To give users the ability to press enter to search the spotify library.

Background

	Jammming currently supports the ability to search for songs, artists and albums by clicking on the on screen search button.
	With over 30 million Spotify users as of 2016 this would be a great functionality to implement. Smartphones and mobile devices have become more 
	popular than Desktop Computers. Even so Desktop computers with an Enter key on the keyboard have 45% of the marketshare worldwide. Implementing
	an enter key press to conduct a search is currently used by many successful technology companies from Facebook, Google, Firefox and LinkedIn in their
	search engines.

This feature would:
	Create a greater ease of access

	Allow a user to type in the search term and quickly press the enter key rather than taking the hands off
	the keyboard and navigate the mouse and mouse cursor over the Search button on screen.

Technical Design

	Wrap SearchBars renders input method in a form tag

		Currently in the searchbar component there is only an input tag with the onChange
		method as well as the "a" tag button with the search method.

		The input tag and the clickable a tag button should be wrapped in a form tag. This
		type of form submit with the two methods work where its a button instead of an "a" tag css button.
		Some experimentation and tweaking would be necessary to assay if both methods would work with the current "a" tag.
		The search method should be moved inside the form tag.

Caveat
		The search button displayed on screen should still work. It would be desired to make sure that both methods(Enter key press and on screen button) 
		function and conduct the search method.

		The search should only be conducted if characters are valid and if characters are entered.
